# Josh's notes as he goes

Holy crap I'm struggling w/JS real hard.



Archiving this from the OG readme:


--------------


## Folder structure

Exercises are grouped by concept. Some concepts will have just one exercise, and will have a `/lib` and `/test` folder. Some will have multiple exercises, each with their own `/lib` and `/test`. Some will have many test files in the `/test` folder.

Each sub-directory has its own README with more info. You'll get the hang of it.

## Running the Tests

These use the browser based testing framework Mocha, along with Chai assertions. You'll run the test to validate your answer to each exercise.

```
$ open concept/exercise/test/test-file.html
```

e.g.

```
$ open objects-and-methods/exercise1/test/index.html
```

## Exercises

* mythical-creatures
* objects-and-methods
